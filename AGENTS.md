## How to work with me

- If anything in my request is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Do not guess.

- Always use Tailwind CSS for styling. Do not use inline styles or CSS modules.
- Our auth system is client-side. Use the useAuth hook from src/lib/auth.tsx.
- When creating new files, follow the existing project structure.
